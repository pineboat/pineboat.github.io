## Why
When you tend to forget faster than you learn, one way to enhance retention is to write about it. That's how it started. Also, others in need might reach here for help.

## What
Document all that is learned as practically as possible and make it available for everyone. A blog, naturally. Ruby on rails, CSS, javascript, TDD, React, Redux, Devops, Travis, Git, Nginx, Passenger, Puma, Postgresql, Virtualbox, Selenium, WebDriver, Software Testing---so much to write about.

## How
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog engine for static site, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. So far, zero cost. A custom domain (cheaper than a good meal) and cloudflare SSL (zero cost again, as I don't expect this to have million visitors every day).
