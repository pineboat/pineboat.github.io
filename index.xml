      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite common to hack with apps on codepen when you are starting out. There will soon be a time when you want to publish your own web apps to the whole world.

      <description>First of all, there is an elaborate post on this by Ben Kamens if you really want to know more on that phrase and what it means to software development.
For quite sometime I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to create my own blog. I wanted to share what I learned. I was forgetting things faster than the rate at which I learned them (I am a web developer, enough said). I wanted to keep writing so that I can retain them longer and also help someone on the way (which could be the future-me trying to solve the same problem).</description>

      <description>Why When you tend to forget faster than you learn, one way to enhance retention is to write about it. That&amp;rsquo;s how it started. Also, others in need might reach here for help.
What Document all that is learned as practically as possible and make it available for everyone. A blog, naturally. Ruby on rails, CSS, javascript, TDD, React, Redux, Devops, Travis, Git, Nginx, Passenger, Puma, Postgresql, Virtualbox, Selenium, WebDriver, Software Testing&amp;mdash;so much learning, but when I hit the same problem again, I tend to search through the same set of forums and solve it a second time in the longest way possible.</description>
