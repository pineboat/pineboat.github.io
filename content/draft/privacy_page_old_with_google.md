Hi, this is Vijayabharathi, author of this blog. I have used Google analytics within Pineboat.in. Google analytics is a small piece of software that tracks visitor (your) information.

No personally identifiable information is tracked. I will NOT be able to track you down and knock at your door. But I'll be able to understand a lot more at aggregate level. Some of them include, but not limited to the following:

* How many visitors from how many countries?
* Where did they come from? (Such as from twitter/github/search..etc)
* What's their OS/Browser versions?
* How long everyone is spending on each post/page?

## Why do I need this data?
Primary motivation behind adding 'Google Analytics' is to see if anyone is reaching this blog. Is anyone is reading? I plan to post articles regularly. I may promote those stories in social media such as twitter. I'd like to understand where my efforts are paying off well.

No advertisement on this blog yet. But sufficient volume may help me understand if it is worth adding any. As of this writing in September 2017, this does not have many visitors. I secretly suspect most of the visits are either mine / from tests I run.

## Want to opt out of tracking?
Google provides a [browser plug-in](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en) which will help you opt out of analytics tracking.

## Twitter for websites
This website (pineboat.in) uses twitter for websites to make it easy for you to share / feedback on content. I have enabled 'Do not track' for twitter buttons/widgets so that twitter does not track your details (which are similar to Google Analytics).
