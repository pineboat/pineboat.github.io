## Notifications take a toll
A whole day checking notifications. They keep coming. 20 / 30 / 50..etc. It might change later, but I am not used to it.
Not able to turn it off on medium either . or i dont know how. that small bell shows off most of the time.
the count is not right anyways.

## Responses 
How do you deal with responses? do you respond to all? or just clap? how do you take criticism? 
do you think people are there to pick a fight?
or genuinely helpful?
what if there is lack of respect? - ignore them?
there is someone wrong in the internet - xkcd
do you recognize opinion / fact. 
willing to alter your content. would that be a defeat (only if you think you are fighting)
will it impact your reputation - you are afraid someone will dig into it? nope, 15k views, 1.5k reads. very few comments (20+) . fewer will even follow the comments. dont worry.
but be ready to face the world. 

use courage to counter being vulnerable.

reassure that this is bound to happen. 

you can choose to ignore.

## How do you generate content?

learn more. keep note of ideas. they pop up in unfortunate and inappropriate times. I have a small 'add note' button on my home screen. it pops up with a title and description. goes away when you click save.

but i use asana for storing all my tasks. so there is a link between asana and evernote using zappier.

in fact, ideas run amok and you may not have time.

## What if someone has already written ? 

No one has written it like you. You add your share of value.
