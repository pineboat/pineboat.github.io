## If you are seeing this

If you are seeing this, it might mean the network is disconnected. Check your data connectivity. It may also mean you tried to visit a page which was removed / never existed.

## You can still read already visited pages

**How's that possible?** That's the power of progressive web app (PWA). Here are few cool things you can do.

* Stays alive when you go offline. 
* You can install this as an app to your mobile's home screen.
* You can visit previously visited posts even when you are offline (as long as you have not cleared browser cache recently).

## Start over from home

**Hit the home link at the top or [here](/)** to start from home. You can possibly read again!

Hope this helps. **Any trouble**, visit the github respository and **[log an issue](https://github.com/pineboat/pineboat.github.io/issues/)**.
