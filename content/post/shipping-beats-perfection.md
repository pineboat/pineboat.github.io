First of all, there is an elaborate [post][KamensBlog] on this by Ben Kamens.

For quite sometime I've been trying to create my own blog. I wanted to share what I learned. I was forgetting things faster than the rate at which I learned them. I wanted to keep writing so that I can retain them longer and also help someone on the way.

But there were quite a few reasons that kept coming to the surface; I didn't realize I was rationalizing until I realized I've been procrastinating for a very long time. Here are some of them which you might identify if you have ever thought about writing in the open internet.

* The color of the link when I hover over was (and is) not having a good contrast.
* Readers might want to engage and I don't have a comment system integrated.
* My blog might never get discovered.
* I should probably do this in a platform like Medium.com
* Medium is too big for me to try and write my first post.
* I better hide away in the thickness of the Internet
* Then why bother writing at all if it is not going to be useful to anyone?
* It'll be embarrassing if someone makes a nasty comment about this post / me.
* The post page needs more css styling
* What if the readers want to subscribe to the blog? Shouldn't I build a readership? Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

While all this was going on, I kept learning new things and didn't write anything. Sever ideas that I thought are good were slipping by since I didn't have a platform ready for me to start writing.

So here I am, making it my first post, giving it a realistic goal,

* Today is 1st August 2017, I'll post this live in 7 days on 8th August.
* I'll add enough CSS in the meantime to ensure this post is readable.
