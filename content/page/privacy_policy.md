**All visitor tracking removed**. 

Hi, this is Vijayabharathi, author of this blog. I have used Google analytics in the past. But not anymore. I have **removed Google Analytics** on 20th May. If you have visited this blog before 20th May, I might have cached a version of that page which might still reach out to Google analytics. But that should go away when you refresh the page or visit it a second time. 

All the social media sharing buttons are also [static and safe](https://sharingbuttons.io/) without any associated tracking script.

I might add some level of visitor tracking at a later point when I fully understand GDPR (which may be *never*). Or when I figure out other simpler options that just give me a count of visits to keep me motivated.

**Bottomline, your secret is safe with you**. I removed every tracking that might know that you visited this blog.
